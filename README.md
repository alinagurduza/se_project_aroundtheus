# Project 3: Around The U.S.

This is the third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

**Project features**

- Figma - exporting images and properties
- Design and specifications
- Grid Layout
- Positioning
- Developing an Interface for different devices (desktop; tablet; mobile)
- HTML/CSS - semantics, BEM methodology
- Font-formats
- CSS file connection

**Figma**

**Images**

The way I've done this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma. Additional, I optimized them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

**Plan on improving the project**

- Improve communication and collaboration
- Create a FAQ with the most common questions and/or errors
